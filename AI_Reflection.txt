# AI Usage Reflection

## Components I Wrote Myself

1. **Calendar Core Structure**
   - Basic monthly calendar grid layout
   - Day component structure
   - Event creation form fields
   - Calendar navigation

2. **Event Management**
   - Event creation and editing logic
   - Color label selection
   - Date and time handling
   - Sports and teams selection dropdowns

3. **Data Management**
   - Context setup for global state
   - Event storage and retrieval
   - Event filtering logic

## AI-Assisted Components

1. **UI Enhancements**
   - Animations and transitions were suggested by GitHub Copilot
   - Some Tailwind CSS class combinations for styling
   - Sidebar component structure was improved with AI suggestions

2. **Event Detail View**
   - Basic structure was mine, but AI helped with:
   - Layout optimization
   - Responsive design classes
   - Error handling patterns

3. **Code Optimization**
   - Some performance improvements in event filtering
   - Date formatting patterns
   - Error handling patterns

## How I Evaluated AI Suggestions

1. **UI/UX Suggestions**
   - Tested all animations for smoothness
   - Verified responsive behavior across screen sizes
   - Ensured accessibility wasn't compromised

2. **Code Suggestions**
   - Reviewed and understood each suggestion
   - Tested edge cases (empty events, invalid dates)
   - Modified suggestions to match project needs

## Technical Decisions

1. **Why React + Vite**
   - Familiar with React ecosystem
   - Vite offers faster development experience
   - Good community support

2. **Why Tailwind CSS**
   - Rapid prototyping capabilities
   - Consistent design system
   - Easy to maintain

3. **Data Management**
   - Chose Context API over Redux for simplicity
   - Local storage for persistence
   - DayJS for better date handling

## Future Improvement

If I had more time, I would implement:

**Advanced Event Filtering**
- Filter events by multiple sports
- Date range filtering
- Search by team names
- Save filter preferences
- Export filtered events

This would make the calendar more useful for users following multiple sports or teams.
